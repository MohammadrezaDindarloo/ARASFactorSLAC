Encoder v4: Using real data and just encoder sensor and the ofset have prior factors. Calibration variables are the pulleys position.
Encoder v5: Using real data and encoder sensor fuse with UWB. Calibration variables are the encoder ofset and pulleys position.
Encoder v6: Using real data ... play with the more data for finding the ofsets as optimization variables.
